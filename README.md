Jenkins pipline runs **Terraform** to provision resources on aws, **Ansible** to configure 2 private instances to be a jenkins salve and install docker on it, and lastly invoking the piplines responsible for deploying node app on these instances.

## Getting started with **Jenkins**
<hr>

I deployed jenkins master server as a docker custom image on my machine.

**First** you need to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) on your machine

I used custom image I built to deploy the master server which is basically a jenkins image with docker-ce-cli you would need it if you want to run docker command but in our case we will not need it, so you can use the official jenkins image.

[official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins):
```
docker run jenkins
```
[my custom image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/refay/jenkins_master):
```
docker run refay/jenkins_master:1.0
```

## Tools configuration on jenkins
<hr>

**Note**: that other versions of tools or plugins may work but I mentioned the versions that worked for me.

**Terraform:**

I used terraform plugin version 1.0.10 check [plugins reference for terraform](https://plugins.jenkins.io/terraform/) for more info.

**Then** after jenkins restarts go to global tool configuration and and terraform installation as follows.

**Ansible:**

I installed ansible as a deb package from apt package manger.

but first you need to exec into the container as root.
```
docker exec -it -u root <containe_name_or_id> bash
```
Then run
```
apt install ansible
```
after installing ansible you need to provide the binary path in the global tool configuration as follows:
